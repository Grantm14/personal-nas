It reflects both practical needs and learning goals.

## Short-Term Goals

- Finalize document management stack
- Improve system monitoring and observability
- Expand documentation coverage

## Medium-Term Goals

- Implement off-site or secondary backups
- Add GPU acceleration for media processing
- Improve remote access security and usability

## Long-Term Goals

- Introduce a second node for workload separation
- Explore service orchestration concepts
- Host additional personal projects on the same infrastructure

## Guiding Principle

This NAS is treated as a living system.
Changes are intentional, documented, and driven by real usage rather
than hypothetical requirements.
